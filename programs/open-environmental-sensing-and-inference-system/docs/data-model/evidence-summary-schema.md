# Evidence Summary Schema

## Purpose

Define a parcel-platform-safe evidence summary object derived from the parcel-state snapshot. This gives UI and API consumers a stable explanation/provenance surface without requiring them to reinterpret the full parcel-state contract.

## Status

Draft

## Owner

Open Environmental Sensing and Inference System

## Field notes

- `headline`
  The top-level explanation line appropriate for compact UI rendering.
- `top_drivers`
  The highest-weight driver contributions from the explanation payload.
- `top_limitations`
  The highest-weight limitation contributions from the explanation payload.
- `grouped_contributions`
  Contribution objects grouped by source class so clients can render evidence cards without recomputing grouping logic.
- `system`
  A reserved source class for engine-detected absences or interpretation limits that are not themselves evidence sources.
- `source_modes`
  High-level provenance classes used in the underlying parcel-state decision.

## Design rules

- Evidence summary is derived from parcel-state and should not invent new inference.
- The shape should stay safe for homeowner-facing UI by default.
- Grouping and ordering should remain stable as new contribution types are added.
